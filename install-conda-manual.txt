1- install anaconda from miniconda installer (I think I took the link from your colab)

2- conda create --name torch_env python=3.9

3- conda activate torch_env

4- conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
NOTE: I had already installed CUDA 12.6 on my laptop. It's very important to match the cuda on the laptop with the one in the command. (12.6 is compatible with 12.1)
to check if it worked, run python cuda_test.py

5- pip install pytorch-lightning

6- pip install pandas

7- pip install tensorboard
